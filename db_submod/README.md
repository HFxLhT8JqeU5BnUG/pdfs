This is a database interface designed to be used as a submodule in other projects. This is due for some refactoring.

To add this as a submodule to a project:

```git submodule add https://github.com/HFxLhT8JqeU5BnUG/db_submod.git db_submod```

Dependencies:
    
    sqlalchemy (create_engine, MetaData, select, Table)
